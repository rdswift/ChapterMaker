<BODY><H2>How Title Case Works</H2>

<p>The utility works by applying a series of rules against the titles, in
the following order:
<ol>
<li>The standard Microsoft title case conversion is applied.<br> <br></li>
<li>The first letter after all typical word separators is capitalized.<br> <br></li>
<li>Adjust the case to that specified in the user-defined words list for all entries not specified as "Always".<br> <br></li>
<li>Adjust the case of the first character immediately following each apostrophe.  For example, "Can'T" would be changed to "Can't".<br> <br></li>
<li>The first letter of the title is converted to upper case, even if preceded by non-letters such as quotes.<br> <br></li>
<li>The first character immediately following every digit is converted to lower case.<br> <br></li>
<li>Adjust the case to that specified in the user-defined words list for all entries specified as "Always".<br> <br></li>
</ol>
The titles in the list are updated with their "corrected" versions. Note
that the resulting titles can still be edited manually to correct any
situations where the title didn't come out as expected.
