<p>In spite of all the planning, testing and best efforts, occasionally
something gets missed and things go wrong. Most error messages generated
by the program will give you some idea of the cause of the problem. In
those cases where a problem is recurring and cannot be resolved using
the information in the error message, please report the problem at
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/chaptermaker/tickets/">https://sourceforge.net/p/chaptermaker/tickets/</a>
including as much information about the problem as possible. We will
review the problem and may contact you for additional information to
ensure a proper solution.
