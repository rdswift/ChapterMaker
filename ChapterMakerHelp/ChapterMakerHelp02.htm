<p>ChapterMaker is an application to assist in preparing and editing video
chapter files. It provides a host of features that allow tremendous
flexibility in the way that the files are prepared.
</p><p>
Chapter times and titles are maintained in separate lists that are
matched up to provide the final collection for export. Both the times
and titles can be imported separately from existing files such as those
from <a href="http://www.chapterdb.org">ChapterDb</a>, or can be
developed from scratch. There is even the ability to develop the chapter
times list from a text file listing the titles and durations, such as
you might copy 'n' paste from websites like <a
href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>.
</p><p>
If you are not importing chapter times from an existing file, they can
be entered manually, or every set interval up to a maximum time.
Individual times can be added, edited or deleted, or blocks of times can
be scaled or shifted. There is also an option to adjust the chapter
times to try to match frame boundaries based on a specified frame rate.
After every change, the times list is re-sorted chronologically.
</p><p>
Individual chapter titles can be inserted, edited or deleted as
required. They can also be re-ordered by dragging and dropping them
within the list. There is a utility included to adjust the titles to
proper title case, based on some customizable word rules. This can be
used at any time.
</p><p>
Once you have the titles matched up to the times as you want them, you
can output your list in either standard XML (Extensible Markup Language),
OGM (Ogg Media) or simple text format files. You have the option of including or
omitting the chapter times and numbers with the titles, and you can set the
language code used for any XML files produced. Simple text files can also
include the duration for each chapter.
</p><p>
Note that the number of
entries in the output file is based on the number of chapter times in
the list. Times with no associated chapter title will be given a default
title &ndash; either "n/a", chapter time or "Chapter #" &ndash; based on the configuration
settings. Chapter titles with no associated time will be ignored.
</p><p>
ChapterMaker is a portable application in that it can be installed in
any directory and does not use the Windows registry. It requires the
.NET Framework 4.0 be installed.
</p><p>
When run, the program tries to read the configuration information from
the program directory and, failing that, from the user's
"AppData\Roaming\ChapterMaker" directory. If no configuration files are
found they will be created automatically.
